## Experiment - 03

### Introduction

  The above figure shows the basic MOS differential-pair configuration. It consists of two matched transistors, Q1 and Q2, whose sources are joined together and biased by a constant-currentsource I.  We assume that the current source is ideal and that ithas infinite output resistance. Although each drain is shown connected to the positive supply
through a resistance RD, in most cases active (current-source) loads are employed.


  
### Aim
  Design a differential amplifier for the following specifications: Vdd=2V , Vin=1V , P=1mW , Vo,cm=1.1V , Vp=0.4V and extract the required parameters.
