# LINEAR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## EXPERIMENT - 06 {CURRENT MIRROR CIRCUIT}

### OBJECTIVE
  To design and analyze a current mirror circuit as an active load in a common-source amplifier. The experiment aims to study the effect of channel length (L) variations on the current mirror accuracy, output resistance, and voltage gain using LTspice simulations.

### DESIGN PARAMETERS
 A) Design and analyze current mirror circuit as active load in common source amplifier circuit.
