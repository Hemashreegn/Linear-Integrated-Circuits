# LINEAR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## EXPERIMENT - 04 {MULTISTABLE MONOVIBRATOR}

### OBJECTIVE
   A monostable multivibrator generates a single output pulse of fixed duration in response to an external trigger. It has one stable state and temporarily switches to an unstable state before returning.

### DESIGN PARAMETERS
   To generate the waveform with pulse width of 0.5 ms using 555 Timer IC.
