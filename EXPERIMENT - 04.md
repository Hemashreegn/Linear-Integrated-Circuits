# LINEAR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## EXPERIMENT - 04 {MONOSTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR}

### OBJECTIVE
   A monostable multivibrator generates a single output pulse of fixed duration in response to an external trigger. It has one stable state and temporarily switches to an unstable state before returning.

### DESIGN PARAMETERS
   To generate the waveform with pulse width of 0.5 ms using 555 Timer IC.

### THEORY
  In some applications the need arises for a pulse of known height and width generated in response to a trigger signal. Because the width of the pulse is predictable, its trailing edge can be used for timing purposesâ€”that is, to initiate a particular task at a specified time. Such a standardized pulse can be generated by the third type of multivibrator, the monostable multivibrator.
  
The monostable multivibrator has one stable state in which it can remain indefinitely. It also has a quasi-stable state to which it can be triggered and in which it stays for a predetermined interval equal to the desired width of the output pulse. When this interval expires, the monostable multivibrator returns to its stable state and remains there, awaiting another triggering signal. The action of the monostable multivibrator has given rise to its alternative name, the one-shot.

Figure (a) shows an op-amp monostable circuit & Figure (b) shows a block diagram representation of the 555 timer circuit.

### WORKING

  --> **In the stable state**, the internal flip-flop of the 555 timer is in the reset condition, making its Q output low and $\overline{Q}$ high, which turns ON the discharge transistor Q1. This causes the external capacitor $C$ to remain discharged with its voltage $v_C \approx 0\,V$. Since the capacitor voltage is below the threshold level ($V_{TH} = \frac{2}{3}V_{CC}$), Comparator 1 outputs a low signal. Also, with no triggering action (i.e., $v_{\text{trigger}} > V_{TL} = \frac{1}{3}V_{CC}$), Comparator 2 also stays low, keeping the flip-flop in the reset state and the output $v_O$ low.

--> **When a negative trigger pulse is applied**, it causes the trigger voltage $v_{\text{trigger}}$ to drop below $V_{TL}$, causing Comparator 2 to output a high signal. This sets the internal flip-flop, making Q high and $\overline{Q}$ low, which in turn switches OFF the discharge transistor Q1 and causes the output $v_O$ to go high. The circuit now enters the quasi-stable state, and with Q1 turned off, the capacitor $C$ starts charging through the external resistor $R$, and its voltage $v_C$ begins to rise exponentially toward $V_{CC}$.

--> **As the capacitor charges**, the voltage across it increases according to the equation $v_C(t) = V_{CC}(1 - e^{-t/RC})$, and the quasi-stable state persists during this charging period. Once $v_C$ reaches the threshold level $V_{TH} = \frac{2}{3}V_{CC}$, Comparator 1 outputs a high signal, resetting the flip-flop again. This causes the Q output to go low and $\overline{Q}$ to go high, turning ON the discharge transistor Q1, which rapidly discharges the capacitor back to 0 V, and the output $v_O$ drops back to low.

--> **The circuit is now back in the stable state**, with the capacitor discharged and the system ready to respond to the next trigger pulse. The duration for which the output $v_O$ remains high (i.e., the width of the pulse) is the time taken by the capacitor to charge from 0 V to $\frac{2}{3}V_{CC}$, which is mathematically given by $T = RC \ln(3) \approx 1.1RC$. This time period is determined by the values of the external resistor $R$ and capacitor $C$, making it highly customizable for timing applications.
