# LINEAR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## EXPERIMENT - 04 {MULTISTABLE MONOVIBRATOR}

### OBJECTIVE
   A monostable multivibrator generates a single output pulse of fixed duration in response to an external trigger. It has one stable state and temporarily switches to an unstable state before returning.

### DESIGN PARAMETERS
   To generate the waveform with pulse width of 0.5 ms using 555 Timer IC.

### THEORY
  In some applications the need arises for a pulse of known height and width generated in response to a trigger signal. Because the width of the pulse is predictable, its trailing edge can be used for timing purposesâ€”that is, to initiate a particular task at a specified time. Such a standardized pulse can be generated by the third type of multivibrator, the monostable multivibrator.
  
The monostable multivibrator has one stable state in which it can remain indefinitely. It also has a quasi-stable state to which it can be triggered and in which it stays for a predetermined interval equal to the desired width of the output pulse. When this interval expires, the monostable multivibrator returns to its stable state and remains there, awaiting another triggering signal. The action of the monostable multivibrator has given rise to its alternative name, the one-shot.
